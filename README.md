# HaPeVR

Currently, the repository with the original project contains software components that cannot be published due to NDA. 
These components will be removed from the project very soon and then it will also be published here.
Until then, only members of the Faculty of Technology at Bielefeld University can access the internal repository with the original project. 

It is located here: https://projects.cit-ec.uni-bielefeld.de/projects/hapevr

Access must first be confirmed, so please send a short e-mail to kkrieger@techfak.uni-bielefeld.de
